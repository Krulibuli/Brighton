# Brighton
School Project
There is minor "@media" query usage for the web pages to fit two computer screens which are for my computer which is 1920x1080 and the school computer that has the width of what I know 2500px+.
*The website is suitable for mobile usage.*
Link for my github page/project for this website: https://github.com/Krulibuli/Brighton
Every commit was made through the account of Krulibuli, those other users that are shown that have commited to this work are just people with wrong credentials from my school PC. Every commit was done by a one person @Krulibuli
